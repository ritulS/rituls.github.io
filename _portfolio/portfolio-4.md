In this research, I integrated the fields of security, Human-computer interaction (HCI), and cognitive science to design, implement, and evaluate a fallback authentication system. The system leverages "Serial Interception Sequence Learning" and incorporates additional auditory and haptic modalities, grounded in principles from cognitive psychology. A comprehensive user study was conducted to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of this innovative approach. This work was accepted in [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/issue/view/521) 2022 under the student abstract and poster tracks. An extension of this work is currently underway, this will be submitted as a full paper in early 2025.
